# How to Connect to Your Raspberry Shake via SSH

Connecting to your Raspberry Shake using SSH allows you to access and manage your device remotely. The following is a step by step guide to setup and connect to your Raspberry Shake from Windows (using either PuTTY or Powershell), from Mac, and from Ubuntu.

## Hardware Setup
   - Connect the power brick to your Raspberry Shake to power it on.
   - Connect one end of an ethernet cable to your Raspberry Shake and plug the other end into an ethernet port on the back of your router.

## How to SSH via Windows PuTTY
   - Open the PuTTY application.
   - Under Host Name (or IP address), enter your Raspberry Shakeâ€™s address, by default this is `rs.local`.
   - Make sure that Port is set to 22.
   - Under Connection type, select SSH.
   - Select Open, and enter Raspberry Shake username and password. By default, these are `myshake` and `shakeme`, respectively.

## How to SSH via Windows Powershell
   - To open PowerShell, either press Ctrl + Shift + P, or hit the Windows key and manually search for PowerShell.
   - Enter this SSH command: `ssh myshake@rs.local` which means to connect the user `myshake` to the device accessible via the address `rs.local` (which is your Raspberry Shake device in your local network).
   - You will be prompted to enter a password. The default password is `shakeme`. Usually, it wouldn't show any characters as you type, but simply type your password and press <ENTER> afterwards.

## How to SSH via Mac
   - Navigate to Applications > Utilities, and open the Terminal application.
   - Enter this SSH command: `ssh myshake@rs.local`
   - You will be prompted to enter a password. The default password is `shakeme`. Usually, it wouldn't show any characters as you type, but simply type your password and press <ENTER> afterwards. 


## How to SSH via Ubuntu
   - Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal.

   - You will be prompted to enter a password. Type the default password `shakeme` and press <ENTER>.
