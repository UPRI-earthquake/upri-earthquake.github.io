### Introduction

The [UPRI EarthquakeHub](https://upri-earthquake.github.io/) contains all the information you need to understand and work with our project. We use Sphinx to generate and maintain this documentation, and the following sections will guide you through the process of accessing it.


    ```

### Accessing the Documentation
To access the project documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Documentation Repository:** Forking a repository is creating a personal copy of a project you want to work on independently. Follow the steps to fork:

- Click on the [upri-earthquake.github.io](https://github.com/UPRI-earthquake/upri-earthquake.github.io) repository
- Click "Fork"
- Select the Destination: When you click "Fork," you'll be prompted to select where you want to fork the repository. Fork it to your user account

Congratulations! You are now have a copy of the project that is under your control, and you can make changes to it as you would with any other Git repository.

2. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone the project's repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-project/repository.git
```

3. **Navigate to the Documentation Directory:** In this repository, the documentation files are stored in a folder named "doc".

```
cd repository/doc
```

4. **Open the Documentation:** Depending on the format, you can access the documentation using a web browser for HTML-based documentation, or a text editor for Markdown, RST or other text-based formats.



## Deploying on GitHub Pages
To deploy your documentation on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Configure GitHub Pages: In your Forked GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Set the source branch to "gh-pages" and the "root" folder. Save the changes.

2. Access the Published Documentation: After a few moments, your documentation will be available at the URL mentioned in the GitHub Pages settings, typically in the format: https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/.
