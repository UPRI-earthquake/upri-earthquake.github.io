How to Connect to Your Raspberry Shake via SSH
================================================


Connecting to your Raspberry Shake using SSH allows you to access and manage your device remotely. The following is a step by step guide to setup and connect to your Raspberry Shake from **Windows (using either PuTTY or Powershell)**, from **Mac**, and from **Ubuntu**.

## Hardware Setup
   - Connect the power brick to your Raspberry Shake to power it on.
   - Connect one end of an ethernet cable to your Raspberry Shake and plug the other end into an ethernet port on the back of your router.
   - Wait for the [Raspberry Shake's ethernet LED indicators](https://manual.raspberryshake.org/specifications.html#led-behavior) to behave as follows:
       - Green light (flashing repeatedly)
       - Orange light (solid)

     **This means that the ethernet port is working as it should.**

## How to SSH via Windows Powershell
   - To open PowerShell, either press Ctrl + Shift + P, or hit the Windows key and manually search for PowerShell.

-----

   - Enter this SSH command: `ssh myshake@rs.local` which means to connect the user `myshake` to the device accessible via the address `rs.local` (which is your Raspberry Shake device in your local network). If it asks to validate the authenticity of the host, simply type "yes"

-----

   - You will be prompted to enter a password. The default password is `shakeme`. Usually, it wouldn't show any characters as you type, but simply type your password and press ENTER afterwards.

-----

   - Once successfully connected, the terminal you are in is now controlling the system of your Raspberry Shake device. You may try the `myshake` command to get a status log of your device. In this case, my test device has a network-station code of `AM_RE722`, this should be different from the code of your device.

-----

   - After you have completed your purpose for connecting to the device, you may close the SSH connection by simply typing `exit` to the prompt. This would return you to the normal terminal prompt for your PC.

## How to SSH via Windows PuTTY
   - To open the PuTTY application, press the Windows key and search for "putty".

     > If PuTTY is not yet installed, you may follow [this link to get the application via Microsoft Store.](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/putty/XPFNZKSKLBP7RJ) Or if you prefer not to download anything, you may try connecting via Powershell instead which comes pre-installed in most Windows operating systems.

   - Input the following:

       - Under Host Name (or IP address), enter your Raspberry Shakeâ€™s address, by default this is `rs.local`.
       - Make sure that Port is set to 22.
       - Under Connection type, select SSH.

-----

   - Click Open, and enter Raspberry Shake username and password. By default, these are `myshake` and `shakeme`, respectively. If it asks about trusting the host, simply click Accept.

   - After you have completed your purpose for connecting to the device, you may close the SSH connection by simply typing `exit` to the prompt. This should exit the terminal window and you are effectively disconnected from the device.

## How to SSH via Mac
   - Navigate to Applications > Utilities (or Other), and open the Terminal application. You may also pres Cmd+Space and type "Terminal"
